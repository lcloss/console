What's that, you say?
More than you wanted to know on the subject can be found here.
Read on:

    - `Terminal Emulator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator>`_
    - `ANSI Escape Codes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code>`_
    - `XTerm Control Sequences
      <http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html>`_
      (`PDF <https://www.x.org/docs/xterm/ctlseqs.pdf>`_)

For example,
to render the text "Hello World" with the attributes of italic and bold,
we output the codes below.
(With ":reverse:`␛`" representing the ASCII escape character.)


.. note::

    Did you know that thirty years before
    `f.lux <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.lux>`_
    and
    `redshift <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift_(software)>`_
    debuted that Amber Monochrome monitors where known as the "ergonomic"
    choice?
    Easier on the eyes for extended periods they said.

    Another example of forgotten knowledge rediscovered.
